<h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
<p>The Plane Mirror Angle Of Incidence Visualization is a Python project that allows users to visualize the angle of incidence on a plane mirror. The project presents an eye, a generic object, and a tall mirror that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the screen. Once the user drops an object, the project displays lines that show the angle of incidence and a phantom version of the generic object behind the mirror where the eye would see the optical illusion. The project also shows light as lines that starts from the generic object and go in the direction of the eyes.</p>
